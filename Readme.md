# NASA Mission Control System

NASA Mission Control is a fun project. Not an official site and is not affiliated with NASA or SpaceX in any way.

## How it works?

On the launch page you can launch your own rockets to a selected habitable planet, which you can choose from a list.
The upcoming page shows you both the upcoming missions based on the SpaceX API and your own launched rockets.
History page has green or red marks for all successful or unsuccessful rocket missions, regarding which one launched or not.

## Usage

```bash
npm run watch
```
